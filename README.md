# Code for Paper (ML-MCPD)

This repository contains the code used in the paper titled "Internal and External Exposure Associations of 3-Monochloropropane-1,2-Diol and Its Esters Using Machine Learning." In this study, various machine learning methods were employed to explore the relationships between internal and external exposures of 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol (3-MCPD).

The code is organized into three main parts:

1. **Data Cleaning and Exploration**: This section focuses on cleaning the data and exploring its characteristics.
2. **Visualization of Associations**: Here, we use machine learning methods with default parameters to visualize the associations between internal biomarkers and external exposure.
3. **Prediction Performance Analysis**: This part evaluates the prediction performance of different machine learning methods with optimized hyper-parameters.

The research data is not publicly available. However, those interested can use their own data to replicate the analyses.
